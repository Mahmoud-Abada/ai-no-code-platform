# Feature Engineering ðŸ“Š

Feature engineering is a crucial step in machine learning where raw data is transformed into meaningful features for better model performance.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Handling Missing Values**: Impute missing values using mean, median, or mode.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical features into numerical representations (One-Hot, Label Encoding).
- **Scaling & Normalization**: Apply Min-Max scaling, Standardization, or Log transformation.
- **Feature Selection**: Select the most important features using correlation and variance thresholding.
- **Feature Generation**: Create polynomial features, interaction terms, and date/time features.
- **Other Features**
